# SUAP Client

> SUAP API client for JavaScript

## Warning
We're actually at development phase, so we'll let you know when this lib gets production ready.

## Installation
``` npm install suap-client ```

or

``` yarn add suap-client ```

## About the lib

SUAP Client will be a traditional API Client Lib to abstract the connection with SUAP API. Plans to evolve to something similar to [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit/rest.js/).

## About the code

This code is based on [this repo](https://github.com/ifrn-oficial/cliente_suap_javascript). We're actually refactoring it, to make it usable as a npm package.
